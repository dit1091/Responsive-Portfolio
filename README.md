# Responsive-Portfolio

The task of this assignment is to create a functional site that showcases one’s background, development work, and contact information: a portfolio. This project includes future assignments that will eventually be included in file "portfolio.html" . The site uses the Bootstrap CSS Framework in order for it to be mobile responsive, which allows the images and design of the site to be viewed at different screen sizes.
